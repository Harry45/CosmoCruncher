# About

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
We strive to make those plugins as modular and generic as possible, so that they can be used in a wide variety of projects and use cases. By providing useful default settings, we also try to make them as easy to use as possible, so that you can get started quickly, tweaking their settings later on. When developing built-in plugins, we always adhere to the following design principles.
