# About

- Emulator for Linear Matter Power Spectrum
- Apply Halofit function on top
- Get the shear and convergence power spectra
- But we need \(\mathtt{CAMB}\) to compute distance
- Allow user to upload \(n(z)\) file in a particular format
- Emulator for the CMB power spectra
- Ecosystem - JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Cosmological Application: Planck 2018
- Cosmological Application: Weak Lensing (KiDS for example)
- Interactive Application to display power spectra
- Allow user to build their custom emulator.

Focus on speed rather than differentiability and other things.

<!-- <p style='text-align: justify;'>
We strive to make those plugins as modular and generic as possible, so that they can be used in a wide variety of projects and use cases. By providing useful default settings, we also try to make them as easy to use as possible, so that you can get started quickly, tweaking their settings later on. When developing built-in plugins, we always adhere to the following design principles.

Does Latex work?

$$
a = b + c

Does python code work?

```py
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
