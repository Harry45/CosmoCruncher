# About

- Emulator for Linear Matter Power Spectrum
- Apply Halofit function on top
- Get the shear and convergence power spectra
- But we need \(\mathtt{CAMB}\) to compute distance
- Allow user to upload \(n(z)\) file in a particular format
- Emulator for the CMB power spectra
- Ecosystem - JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Cosmological Application: Planck 2018
- Cosmological Application: Weak Lensing (KiDS for example)
- Interactive Application to display power spectra
- Allow user to build their custom emulator.

Focus on speed rather than differentiability and other things.

Does Latex work?

$$
a = b + c
$$

Does python code work?

```py
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
```
